System Manager Structure {#STRUCTURE}
========================

The SM structure contains an upper-level that is hardware independent and a lower-level
that is hardware dependent. The upper-level deals with RPC and logical machine management
and the lower-level abstracts the device (aka SoC) and the board.

Hardware Independent Structure
------------------------------

The figure below shows the logical structure of the hardware independent modules of the SM.
This includes the RPC modules (mailbox, transport, protocol) and the logical machine manager. 
These modules support multiple instances (i.e. configuration/dynamic data) of the function
and the figure shows how these instances interact with each other.

<br>

These modules are configured and their instances linked together using configuration data.
This data is constant and defined using header files. See @ref CONFIGURATION for more info
on these structures and how they are constructed. These modules also maintain dynamic data
for each of the instances. Examples include specified power domain state, notification
enablement, etc.

Various IDs used for identifying modules and module istances are as follows:

| Construct        | External Ref           | Internal Ref |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Mailbox instance | mbType+mbInst          | *various*    |
| SMT channel      | xportType+xportChannel | smtChannel   |
| SCMI channel     | rpcType+rpcChannel     | scmiChannel  |
| SCMI agent       |                        | agentId      |
| SCMI instance    | rpcType+rpcInst        | scmiInst     |
| LM               | lmId                   | lmId         |

### Mailboxes

Mailbox modules connect physical hardware to transport channels. Some provide only doorbells (aka
interrupts) while others may provide a serial communication stream. Mailbox modules support multiple
instances and these instances can support multiple doorbells. There is usually one instance per
hardware module and one channel/doorbell per transport channel.

The SM as delivered supports two mailbox modules. One is for the MU IP and one is for loopback
testing. The @ref MB_MU interfaces the SDK MU driver with transport modules. One instance per
MU. Each MU has four general purpose interrupts and these are used as doorbell interrupts. The
@ref MB_LOOPBACK provides a doorbell between unit tests and the transport for the simulation
build. Both of these only provide a doorbell and do not move data. They are intended to work with
transports that use shared memory for the data transport (e.g. SMT). One requirement imposed by the
SCMI standard is that a mailbox IP (e.g. MU) cannot be shared between multiple users, agents in the
case of SCMI.

### Transports

Transports connect mailboxes to protocols. They are responsible for moving the message payload data.
This is done via shared memory or streamed via a serial protocol. Transports also do any required
data copy and CRC checking of the data. Transports support multiple independent streams of data
called channels. Each channel requires a mailbox doorbell and connects to a protocol channel.

The only transport delivered with the SM is the @ref RPC_SMT. This transport supports multiple
channels, each with a dedicated shared memory buffer. Each channel has 128 bytes of shared memory
and the same buffer is used for transmit and receive.

### Protocols

Protocols are used to parse RPC requests and turn them into calls to the LMM. Multiple protocols
can exist, but [SCMI](@ref RPC_SCMI) is the default supported by the SM. Protocols are bound to
transport channels and logical machines. Protocols may support multiple logical instances. These
have common code but different configuration and dynamic data. A single protocol instance is bound
to an LM but might be bound to multiple transport channels. A channel might be used for API calls
while another channel might be used for asynchronous notifications. Protocols are referenced by
adjacent modules using *rpcType* and *rpcInst*.

The [SCMI](@ref RPC_SCMI) protocol supports multiple instances denoted internally by *scmiInst*.
A single instance can be bound to an LM. SCMI also supports the concept of multiple clients. Examples
include ATF and Linux. Both run on a common core/cluster and are defined as a single LM. They make
use of a single instance of SCMI, but each needs a communication channel with defined access rights
and each has individual state. SCMI calls denotes each of these clients as an agent. These are denoted
using an *agentId*. Configuration and dynamic data are maintained for each agent. Each agent is then
bound to transport channels, usually multiple. State passed to the LM is aggregated across all agents
in the SCMI instance.

The definition of SCMI instances and agents within those instances depends on the desired interaction.
Clients that are in different LMs must be in different RPC instances. Clients that work together,
interact with each other via the protocol, boot together, reboot together, have a common power state,
etc. would typically be in a single RPC instance.

Protocols really only have a few functions to call. For example, the SCMI protocol has the
RPC_SCMI_Init() function to initialize the protocol, RPC_SCMI_Dispatch() to dispatch an incoming
message, RPC_SCMI_Reset() to reset an instance (used when the LM reboots), and RPC_SCMI_Trigger()
to trigger a notification.

### Logical Machines

The @ref LMM manages multiple logical machines (LM). Example logical machines include
the M33 running the SM, or a Cortex-A cluster running Linux. These are denoted using a logical
machine ID (*lmId*). All of the API calls for this module take an *lmId* parameter to indicate which
LM the operation should affect. The operation usually results in state being aggregated across all
LM and passed to the device or board. While not required, most LM are bound to an RPC protocol.
Note an LM can only be bound to one protocol. Binding is done via constant configuration data. The
LMM_PowerStateSet() function is an example of an LMM function.

Hardware Dependent Structure {#DEV_API_STRUCTURE}
----------------------------

The figure below shows the logical structure of the hardware dependent modules of the SM.
This includes the Device/Board SM abstraction layer and the MCUXpresso SDK. These modules support
a single instance (i.e. configuration/dynamic data) of the function. They manage the state of
the system as a whole and have no understanding that the device has been logically divided by
the LMM.

### DEV_SM_API Redirection

The LMM calls the [Device SM abstraction layer API](@ref DEV_SM_API). This will call the DEV_SM or
BRD_SM depending on the definition of the redirect defines (e.g. ::SM_POWERSTATESET). By default,
these point to the DEV_SM layer. The BRD_SM layer can redefine these to point to itself. This is usually
done to add board resources to the lists of resources (power domains, clocks, sensors, voltages, etc.)
managed by the SM. When added these are managed by the LMM and exposed via the RPC just like device
resources. An example is adding the PMIC temp sensor. The ::SM_NUM_SENSOR define is overridden to add the
sensor to the number and associated functions can then also be overridden. For example the
::SM_SENSORREADINGGET define is overridden to point to BRD_SM_SensorReadingGet(). The board functions
then call the DEV_SM layer for device resources and directly handle board resources.

### SM Device/Board Abstraction

There are two SM abstractions to the hardware support code: device (DEV_SM) and board (BRD_SM).

The DEV_SM interface abstracts the MCUXpresso SDK but also provides additional functionality
required by the SM. For example, the DEV_SM_PowerStateSet() function is a simple abstraction of
calls to the SDK functions PWR_MixSoftPowerUp() and PWR_MixSoftPowerDown(). However the
DEV_SM_PowerDomainNameGet() function returns the text names of the domains which is not available
via any SDK call. Note DEV_SM function sometimes call board functions as well. For example,
DEV_SM_PerfLevelSet() calls BRD_SM_SupplyLevelSet() to set the PMIC supply voltage when doing a
DVFS operating point change.

The BRD_SM interface abstracts the MCUXpresso SDK board port. It is primarily used to add
board-level resources by redirecting functions that control resources (power domains, clocks,
sensors) using the DEV_SM_API redirection capability. These functions then usually call board functions
for the new resources and call DEV_SM functions for the device resources. An example of this is
supporting PMIC temperature sensors.

### MCUXpresso SDK

Bootflow {#BOOTFLOW}
========

The boot flow starts in main(). This then has the following flow:

- BRD_SM_Init() - to initialize the hardware, usually does something like:
  - BOARD_InitHardware() - initialize the board hardware
  - BRD_SM_SerialDevicesInit() - initialize board serial devices
  - DEV_SM_RomBootCpuGet() - get the mSel value from the boot container
  - DEV_SM_Init() - initialize the device (aka SoC)
- Prints the SM Hello banner
- LMM_Init() - initialize the LM manager
  - Initializes all the LMM cmponents via init functions like LMM_ClockInit()
  - Initializes the RPC interface for each LM via a function like RPC_SCMI_Init()
- LMM_Boot() - starts the LMs as configured
  - Loops over all the LM and optionally starts them depending on the mSel and boot order
  - Call SWI_Trigger() to trigger an interrupt to do the start
- TEST_Config() - called if a unit test is to be run (T=\<test\>)
- TEST() - called if a unit test is to be run (T=\<test\>)
- MONITOR_Cmd() - called if the monitor is included (M=1)
- Loops forever calling WFI to enter a low power state

The mSel value is used to selected from multiple boot configurations. The board code usually gets the
value from the boot container but may also get/modify the mSel from reading GPIO. The mSel can also be
obtained/modified from the FuSa component in some cases. See mSel references in @ref CONFIGURATION.

The LM [configuration data](@ref LMM_CONFIG) has two variables that affect boot: boot and bootskip.
These are arrays with a value per mSel index. The boot variable indicates the boot order 1-n, 0
indicates not to boot. It two LM have the same boot order then they start in LM index order. The
bootSkip parameter indicates if an error starting a CPU should be ignored. When ignored the error
is just recorded in the LM status but the boot process will continue. bootSkip values are 0=error
is fatal and boot process stops (default), 1=skip error and continue with the next LM.

Example Fault Flow {#FAULT_EXAMPLE}
==================

The following is an example code flow of a fault. It originates from the FCCU interrupt. The
purpose is generate reactions to the fault and inform the FCCU the fault has been handled (aka
recovered). If the SM does not report the fault is resolved with the configured timeout, the
FCCU is configured to reset the system.

- **FCCU_INT0_IRQHandler()** - shim from the vector table to the associated device handler
  - Just calls VFCCU_ALARM_ISR()
- **VFCCU_ALARM_ISR()** - process the fault

  - Calls DEV_SM_FaultSet() to clear the fault if handled (recovered)
  - Disables the FCCU interrupts if the fault is not handled
- **SM_FAULTCOMPLETE()** - shim to LMM_FaultComplete()
- **LMM_FaultComplete()** - generate fault reaction
  - Calls LMM_FaultReactionGet() to get the configured reaction
    - Calls BRD_SM_FaultReactionGet() which allows for the info to be recorded in
      persistent storage and/or printed to the debug UART
  - Calls LMM_FusaFaultRecover() to allow the FuSa component to send notifications
    and/or override the fault reaction
  - Calls LMM functions (e.g. LMM_SystemReset(), LMM_SystemLmReset()) to handle reaction
  - If recovered, calls LMM_FusaFaultCleared() to clear fault, this will also re-enable
    the FCCU interrupts
- Returns back out of functions until it returns from the interrupt.

Note if the fault isn't recovered, then the FCCU interrupt will remain disabled and the FCCU
will start a timer to the delayed reaction (system reset). If an agent has been sent a fault
notification it has this time to send a fault clear message to recover the fault.
