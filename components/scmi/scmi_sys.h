 * This function is used to power down or reset the LM or full SoC. An example
 * power state is ::SCMI_SYS_STATE_SHUTDOWN. The ::SCMI_SYS_STATE_MODE state is
 * unique in that it does not cause an immediate state change. Instead,
 * bits[23:16] are the sleep mode and bits[15:0] are sleep flags. These are
 * aggregated and the and the result used the next time the SoC enters sleep to
 * determine what mode is entered and which features stay on. The setting of
 * the bits is SoC and board specific.
 *
 * Note the SCMI spec defines the standard states to affect the system. In SM,
 * the system in this case is defined as the LM the SCMI agent is a part of.
 * There are vendor-defined states to set the state of the full SoC (e.g.
 * ::SCMI_SYS_STATE_FULL_SHUTDOWN) but these require elevated permission to
 * set. See the @ref SYS_ARCH_LM section for more info.
 *
 * System power-up must only be available to agents other than a PSCI
 * implementation on systems that implement OSPM system view. Access depends on
 * if graceful, LM, or system state request. See section 4.4.2.5

 * If an agent has registered for system power state notifications with

 * agent. Typically, the agent is either:
 *
 * - The OSPM that initiates a system power state transition in response to
 * this notification. The OSPM needs this notification to become aware that a
 * remote entity such as the management agent or the privileged agent is
 * requesting a graceful power state transition.
 *
 * - A management agent or a privileged agent that initiated a graceful power
 * state transition and is waiting for the OSPM to perform a power state
 * transition in response. The management agent or privileged agent needs this
 * notification to confirm that the platform controller has successfully
 * received the power state transition request from the PSCI agent, or from the
 * OSPM for non-PSCI compliant systems. See section 4.4.3.1
